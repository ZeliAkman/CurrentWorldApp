<h1> <a>Current World (News App)</a></h1>

<p>I have kept the project very minimal and useful.
We have a bottom navigation with three categories – headlines, favorites, and search.
As you can see in the headlines the latest news is shown here. All, of them, are fetched from news API in real-time.
You, can even click on it and see it opens up the article in a web view. You can scroll through it and you can save it in your favorites section by clicking on this floating acting button.
it’s saved here in favorites – not, just that but you can also remove it from favorites by swiping it and you can undo it as well.
Then, go to the search section. you can literally search anything it will come up with the results </p>
<h3> Technical about Project </h3>
Now, let’s go into the technical side of it.

To, display all these articles are using news API which I’ll show you later. So, with the help of that, it fetches the real-time data or news and displays it on the recycler view.
Then, with the help of web view – we, can open the article in the app itself without going to any browser.
Then, by clicking on add to fav – that, particular article gets saved in the room database so what you see here is all saved in the room database hence later whenever you open the app again – they, will be still here.
Lastly, search uses API only, and other topics like MVVM will help us to make the project organized and segregated in model view and ViewModel not, just that but also the navigation component will help us to navigate from one screen to another screen effortlessly.
